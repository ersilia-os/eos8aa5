# Knowledge-guided pre-trained graph transformer

Neural fingerprints (embeddings) based on a knowledge-guided graph transformer. This model reprsents a novel self-supervised learning framework for the representation learning of molecular graphs, consisting of a novel graph transformer architecture, LiGhT, and a knowledge-guided pre-training strategy.
