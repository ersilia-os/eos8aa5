Description: 'Neural fingerprints (embeddings) based on a knowledge-guided graph transformer.
  This model reprsents a novel self-supervised learning framework for the representation
  learning of molecular graphs, consisting of a novel graph transformer architecture,
  LiGhT, and a knowledge-guided pre-training strategy.
