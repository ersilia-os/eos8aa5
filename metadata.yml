Title: Knowledge-guided pre-trained graph transformer
Description: Neural fingerprints (embeddings) based on a knowledge-guided graph 
  transformer. This model reprsents a novel self-supervised learning framework 
  for the representation learning of molecular graphs, consisting of a novel 
  graph transformer architecture, LiGhT, and a knowledge-guided pre-training 
  strategy.
